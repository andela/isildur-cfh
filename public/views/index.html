          We're quite sure you feel the same way, so we've integrated donation widgets (via crowdrise.com), along with some not-so-subtle reminders throughout the game to give you the opportunity to donate. If you're signed in when you donate, we'll even upgrade your account and place a crown on your avatar's head (to remind other players how much better you are than them).
  All donations go to the Make-a-Wish Foundation and benefit children in need.
